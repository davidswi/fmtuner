FMTuner -- An HTML FM tuner application
=======================================
FMTuner is an exploration of HMTL UI with Javascript backing logic that communicates with an Si470x FM tuner IC connected to a Linux system via USB. The Javascript code uses the FMTuner object to open a connection to the tuner hardware, enumerate available stations and tune to a requested station. The FMTuner object is a native WebKit Javascript extension that is implemented according to the procedure described in this Use(less) Bytes blog posting:

The FMTuner C implementation talks to the radio-usb-si470x driver via the user mode interface demonstrated in the test app fmtools, located at http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/fmtools/
